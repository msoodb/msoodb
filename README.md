### Hi there

I'm **Masoud Bolhassani (msoodb)** — a passionate C developer focused on embedded systems, low-level programming, and system tools.

- I’m currently working on **Belfhym** (a modular embedded system for autonomous drones and lunar rovers) and **Trafix** (a Linux network traffic analysis tool).
- I’m currently deepening my expertise in embedded firmware design and real-time systems.
- I’m also the author of a book available on Amazon: [Modern Cryptology](https://a.co/d/iHDMVmH)
- Ask me about: STM32, FreeRTOS, CMSIS, Linux systems programming, or network tools.
- How to reach me: [GitHub](https://github.com/msoodb) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/msoodb).
- Fun fact: I love making lightweight, efficient C code that talks directly to hardware!
