### Hi
I'm **Masoud Bolhassani (msoodb)** — a passionate C developer focused on embedded systems, low-level programming, and system tools.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Belfhym** (a modular embedded system for autonomous drones and lunar rovers) and **Trafix** (a Linux network traffic analysis tool).
- 🌱 I’m currently deepening my expertise in embedded firmware design and real-time systems.
- 💬 Ask me about: STM32, FreeRTOS, CMSIS, Linux systems programming, or network tools.
- 📫 How to reach me: [GitHub](https://github.com/msoodb) or [my website](https://msoodb.org).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love making lightweight, efficient C code that talks directly to hardware!
